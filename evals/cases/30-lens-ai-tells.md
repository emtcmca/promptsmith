## Must

- Report findings **worst-first by priority**: P0 the unfilled `[Company]` / `[Insert CTA here]`
  placeholders, then P1 tiered vocabulary, then P2 rhythm/structure.
- Tier the vocabulary correctly — Tier 1 always-flag (`leverage`, `delve`, `robust`, `seamless`,
  `cutting-edge`, `game-changing`, `foster`, `underscore`, `realm`, `tapestry`, `testament`,
  `landscape`, `navigate`, `elevate`, `unlock`, `embark`) vs Tier 2 clustered (`comprehensive`,
  `holistic`, `intricate`) vs Tier 3 density (`meaningful`, `impactful`).
- Catch the template phrases: "In today's rapidly evolving landscape," "It's not just X — it's
  Y," "Let's dive in," "Ready to transform…?"
- Quote each offending span rather than only naming the category.
- Produce the cleaned rewrite, then run the **second pass** and report it.

## Must not

- Introduce new tells in the rewrite (the second pass exists to catch exactly that).
- Flag every Tier 3 word on a single appearance — Tier 3 is a density signal.
- Leave the placeholders unflagged, or fill them with invented values.
