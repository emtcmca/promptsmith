## Input

```
/promptsmith:sharpen draft a violation notice for an unresolved fence-height dispute
```

## Must

- Treat the governing provision, dates, and owner details as **facts to confirm** — represent
  them as bracketed placeholders or flagged assumptions, never invented values.
- Apply the editorial lens (clear, firm-but-neutral tone; lead with the matter).
- Surface that due process (notice, cure period, escalation) must be specified, and flag where
  legal/governing-doc grounding is required.

## Must not

- Cite a specific CC&Rs/bylaws section number, fine amount, statute, or deadline that wasn't
  provided. **Any fabricated provision = hard-gate FAIL (faithfulness).**
- Adopt a threatening or editorializing tone.
