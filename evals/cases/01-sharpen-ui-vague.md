command: /promptsmith:sharpen
expected-lenses: [visual-design, ux-designer, accessibility]
tests: gap-fill on a vague request, real push-back, lens auto-pick
---

## Input

```
/promptsmith:sharpen make the settings page nicer
```

## Must

- Gap-fill the vagueness with labeled, reversible assumptions (what "nicer" means, stack,
  audience) rather than stalling or asking up front.
- Auto-pick UI lenses (visual-design / ux-designer / accessibility) and reflect their
  checklists in REQUIREMENTS.
- Push-back must name that "nicer" is unmeasurable and force concreteness — not flatter.
- Name target adjectives explicitly (e.g. calm, ordered, trustworthy).

## Must not

- Invent product facts (existing components, brand colors, a specific framework) as if known —
  those are facts to flag, not assume.
- Leave any `<placeholder>` unfilled.
