# Using promptsmith

A practical sheet for a new user — human or agent — to get value out of promptsmith fast.

promptsmith is prompt & context engineering delivered as a Claude Code plugin, in **two layers**:

- **Layer 1 (core)** — zero model calls, model-agnostic, paste-anywhere. Three commands that
  turn rough input into sharp output: `/sharpen`, `/forge-agent`, `/lens`.
- **Layer 2 (coordinator)** — `/orchestrate`. Dispatches live specialist subagents to handle a
  multi-domain request and synthesizes one deliverable. Needs a host that can spawn subagents
  (Claude Code).

## 1. Install

**As a plugin (recommended):**
```
/plugin marketplace add emtcmca/promptsmith
/plugin install promptsmith
```
Verify: type `/promptsmith` — `/promptsmith:sharpen`, `:forge-agent`, `:lens`, `:grade`,
`:orchestrate` should autocomplete. (Plugin commands are namespaced — bare `/sharpen` only exists
with the manual/standalone install in the README.)

Then run `/promptsmith:lens --lens skeptic` on any short paragraph. If it reports running the
`skeptic` lens, the bundled lens library resolved correctly. Autocomplete alone doesn't prove the
install — the commands can load while the files they read don't.

---

## 2. Which command do I use?

| You have… | Use | You get back |
|---|---|---|
| a rough one-off task | `/promptsmith:sharpen` | a complete, gap-filled, reviewed **prompt** |
| an assistant you want to reuse | `/promptsmith:forge-agent` | a durable **system prompt** |
| something to critique (code, prompt, UI, draft) | `/promptsmith:lens` | **findings**, worst-first |
| a multi-domain build/task | `/promptsmith:orchestrate` | **one synthesized deliverable** |

Rule of thumb: one domain → a core command (or one gallery agent). More than one domain that
must end as a single coherent result → `/orchestrate`.

## 3. The core commands

### `/promptsmith:sharpen <rough request>`
Turns a vague ask into an executable prompt: role, objective, context, requirements (with the
tone adjectives named), guardrails from a red-team pass, success criteria, output format, and
out-of-scope — then the assumptions it made, the push-back worth hearing, and open questions.
```
/promptsmith:sharpen make the settings page feel calmer and more trustworthy
/promptsmith:sharpen draft a violation notice for a fence dispute --lens editorial --deep
```
- `--lens a,b` — force specific lenses (else it auto-picks by topic).
- `--deep` — interview you one question at a time instead of assuming.

### `/promptsmith:forge-agent <description>`
Turns "an agent that reviews HOA letters for tone" into a complete, reusable system prompt —
role, a named **voice**, operating principles, method (with a baked-in self-challenge step),
guardrails, and an output contract. It seeds from the gallery when a close match exists and
states what it adapted from.
```
/promptsmith:forge-agent a reviewer that critiques API endpoints for security holes
```

### `/promptsmith:lens <artifact> [--lens a,b]`
Reviews an existing prompt/page/component/draft through expert lenses and returns findings
(✅ checked / ⚠️ weak / ❌ failing), worst-first, with the top-3 fixes. By default it critiques
and does not rewrite. Add `--fix` and it emits a corrected version of the artifact in its own
form — prose stays prose, code stays code, a prompt comes back sharpened — making the minimal
targeted change that resolves each finding.
```
/promptsmith:lens (paste a React component) --lens accessibility,visual-design
/promptsmith:lens (paste a React component) --lens accessibility --fix
```

### `/promptsmith:grade <prompt> [--against <v2>] [--rubric a,b]`
Scores a prompt rather than critiquing it: a PASS / WEAK / FAIL verdict, the nine concerns a
complete prompt resolves marked ✅/⚠️/❌, an adversarial quality pass, and the 2–3 fixes that raise
the score most. It grades **coverage, not conformance** — a prompt that resolves a concern in one
fluent sentence passes, and is never penalized for not looking like promptsmith output.

`--against` scores two versions on the same rubric and reports per-dimension deltas, **naming any
dimension that regressed even when the revision wins overall**. That is what eyeballing a rewrite
misses, and it's the same score → change → re-score → keep-only-what-didn't-regress loop the
project runs on itself in `evals/`.
```
/promptsmith:grade (paste a system prompt)
/promptsmith:grade (paste the revision) --against (paste the original)
```

**`lens` vs `grade`:** `lens` answers *what's wrong with this?* through a professional's
checklist. `grade` answers *how good is this, and did my change help?* Findings versus a
measurement. Use `lens` to find problems, `grade` to track whether you fixed them.

---

## 4. Lenses

A lens is a professional's checklist in a markdown file. The 12 built-ins: `visual-design`,
`ux-designer`, `accessibility`, `security-reviewer`, `performance`, `api-design`,
`data-integrity`, `seo`, `product-strategist`, `editorial`, `ai-tells`, `skeptic` (applied by
default).

**Add your own** (no fork): drop a markdown file with `name:` + `applies-to:` frontmatter into
`~/.claude/promptsmith-lenses/` (everywhere) or `./.promptsmith-lenses/` (one project). It's
auto-loaded and selectable by `--lens <name>` or by topic.

---

## 5. The agent gallery (20 specialists)

`agents/` holds ready-to-paste **specialist system prompts** — each with a named voice and a
self-challenge step. Two ways to use them:

- **Directly:** open `agents/<name>.md` and paste its body into a subagent, a skill, or any
  system-prompt field.
- **Via `/orchestrate`:** the coordinator dispatches them for you.

Roster: **Build** — feature-spec, planner, data-modeler, backend-builder, frontend-builder,
test-author, refactor-planner · **Review** — api-reviewer, security-review, verifier, evaluator,
compliance-reviewer, debugger · **Write** — copy-rewrite, docs-writer, sop-writer,
governance-letter · **Meta** — research-synthesizer, prompt-engineer, mcp-integrator.

Forge a new one with `/forge-agent` and drop it in `agents/` to grow the roster.

---

## 6. Orchestration — `/promptsmith:orchestrate <multi-domain request>`

For work that spans several specialists. The coordinator:
1. **Gates** — declines if it's really single-domain (routes you to one command instead).
2. **Sharpens** the request, then **decomposes** it into non-overlapping slices.
3. **Routes** each slice to the best gallery agent; **logs any slice no agent covers** as a
   coverage gap (a `/forge-agent` candidate).
4. **Owns the seams** — assigns one owner to every shared decision; resolves cross-agent
   conflicts, or **escalates** product/risk calls to you.
5. **Dispatches** the agents as live subagents (parallel where independent).
6. **Synthesizes** one coherent deliverable — not a pile of agent outputs.

```
/promptsmith:orchestrate add public read-only shareable links to user dashboards
```
- **Smart approval gate:** small/low-risk plans (≤3 agents) auto-run; larger ones pause for your
  approval first. `--gate` forces the pause; `--no-gate` runs autonomously; `--dry` shows the
  decomposition + routing without dispatching.

What you get: the deliverable first, then the decomposition, seam owners, resolved conflicts,
coverage gaps, and what each agent contributed.

## 7. For agents using promptsmith

- Invoke a command via the Skill tool with the namespaced name (e.g. `promptsmith:sharpen`),
  passing the request as args.
- The engines are plain method + structure (`skills/prompt-engineering/SKILL.md` for Layer 1,
  `skills/orchestration/SKILL.md` for Layer 2) — an agent can read and run them directly.
- Honesty guardrails are baked in and must be respected: never invent facts (provisions, numbers,
  stacks), sources, or MCP servers; flag them as assumptions/verify-items instead.

---

## 8. Testing & refining (the eval harness)

`evals/` is a host-judged harness: structural invariants + an adversarial skeptic rubric over 27
cases. Run it by saying **"run the promptsmith evals"** (all) or **"run eval case 17"** (one).
It writes a dated scorecard to `evals/runs/`. To refine: change a lens/engine/agent, re-run the
same cases, diff the scorecards, keep only non-regressing improvements.
