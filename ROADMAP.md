# promptsmith roadmap

## Architecture: two layers

Decided 2026-06-24. promptsmith is built in two deliberately separate layers so the founding
identity survives the ambition.

**Layer 1 — promptsmith-core (current, shipping).**
The portable prompt & context engineering method: `/sharpen`, `/forge-agent`, `/lens`, the
shared engine, the lens library, and the pre-forged agent gallery. **No model calls, no API
keys, model-agnostic, paste-anywhere.** This is the defensible identity and it stays intact.

**Layer 2 — orchestration (planned, deferred).**
promptsmith as a *coordinator*: sharpen the prompt to perfection, decompose it into
non-overlapping slices, dispatch each to the right specialist as a live subagent, then receive,
assemble, and curate their work into one coherent result before returning it. This layer is
**Claude-Code-native** — it requires a runtime that can spawn subagents (Task / Workflow), so
it has runtime dependencies the core does not. It is built **last**, only after core + gallery
are tuned, per "build from the ground up; staff the coordinator last."

The gallery is the bridge: today its files are paste-ready system prompts; under Layer 2 they
become the **specialist roster** the coordinator dispatches to. Nothing built now is wasted.

## Now — Layer 1 build & tune

- [x] Engine, three commands, templates, eight base lenses (initial scaffold).
- [x] Real-run test pass — validated engine on a live request (`docs/test-runs/`).
- [x] Fix plugin command references to the namespaced form; fix standalone install's lens copy.
- [x] Add `seo`, `api-design`, `data-integrity` lenses (cover the common out-of-scope items).
- [x] Start the pre-forged agent gallery: `feature-spec`, `copy-rewrite`, `api-reviewer`.
- [x] Wire `/forge-agent` to seed from the gallery before building cold.
- [ ] Grow the gallery to cover the rest of the out-of-scope map:
  - [ ] `perf-audit` (performance lens) — speed/scale/payload audit.
  - [ ] `seo-auditor` (seo lens) — crawl + metadata + CWV pass.
  - [ ] `security-review` agent (security-reviewer + data-integrity).
- [ ] Tune from real use: run each command/agent on real tasks, log friction in `docs/test-runs/`,
      fix the engine/templates/lenses. Core is "tuned" when real runs stop surfacing defects.
- [ ] Merge `test/real-run-pass` to main once the gallery + tuning land.
- [ ] Push to GitHub (`emtcmca/promptsmith`); flip marketplace source from local path to repo.

## Later — Layer 2 orchestration (runtime deps; build after core+gallery tuned)

The hard, failure-prone parts — design these hardest:

- **Decomposition.** Split the sharpened prompt into specialist slices with no overlap and no
  gaps. Decide who owns each seam.
- **Dispatch.** Route each slice to the right gallery specialist as a live subagent; run
  independent slices in parallel.
- **Assembly + curation.** Merge conflicting outputs into one voice — dedup, resolve
  contradictions, enforce consistent tone/format. This synthesis step is the real moat (cf.
  Auris coordinator synthesis). A pile of subagent outputs is not a deliverable.
- **Guardrails.** Detect when orchestration is overkill (a single agent does it better) and
  fall back to plain `/sharpen`. Cap fan-out. Surface what each specialist did.

Open questions to resolve before Layer 2:
- Host mechanism: Task tool vs. Workflow harness for dispatch + assembly?
- How does the coordinator pick specialists — lens/topic match, or an explicit routing pass?
- Where does the user approve the decomposition before fan-out (cost + correctness gate)?
